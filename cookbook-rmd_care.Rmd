# Caring for your site {#rmd-care}

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align="center")
```


```{r, out.width = "65%", fig.align='center', echo= FALSE}

```

Once you have the website in place, it's likely that you will want to update it periodically or add new pages. The key to updating is that you must build your site or use `rmarkdown::render_site()` each time before you push to GitHub--otherwise your changes wouldn't make it into your `docs/` folder. And if it's not in the `docs/` then GitHub pages will not be able to find it. 

Here's what the add-new-pages workflow looks like for me:

1. **Open** the existing site RStudio project
2. **Run** "Build Site" or `rmarkdown::render_site()` right away to see where things left off.
3. **Create** a new `.Rmd` document in RStudio using *File > New File > R Markdown*, and delete its default YAML except for the title, then edit away.
4. **Update** your `_site.yml` by adding the new page's `.html` file to the navbar section. **Note: It's very easy to forget this step!!**
6. **Run** `rmarkdown::render_site()` to stitch everything together.
7. **Rinse and repeat** if needed!
8. **Commit and push** all changes to GitHub.

## Adding new pages {#add-rmd}

Adding new pages to your site means adding new `.Rmd` files to your site's project root directory. You can do this in RStudio using *File > New File > R Markdown*. Delete the default YAML except for the title and all text/code in the document, then edit away.

## Grow your navbar {#rmd-grow}

To make a new page actually findable from your site, you'll need to *also* make a change to navbar, which means opening up the `_site.yml` file and fiddling with it. To add another R Markdown link to your navbar, you need to know two things about the new page you want to add:

1. The **name you want to see** on the navbar for this page; this is the page's `text`.

1. The **name of the `.html` file** that corresponds to the `.Rmd` file you're adding; this is the page's `href`

Let's say we create a new file called `labs.Rmd`. We want to add the link to the rendered page `labs.html` to our upper navbar next to "Home" and "Lectures", so we would add the following to our YAML:

```{r echo = FALSE}
yml_empty() %>%
  yml_navbar(
    left = list(
      navbar_page("Home", href = "index.html"),
      navbar_page("Lectures", href = "lectures.html"),
      navbar_page("Labs", href = "labs.html")
    )) %>% 
  asis_yaml_output(fences = FALSE)
```

\

Save the changes to `_site.yml`, build, and preview to see the new page appear in the upper navbar.

<div class = side-by-side>
<div class = side1>

```{r echo = FALSE}
yml_empty() %>% 
  yml_site_opts(
    name = "YUM-101",
    output_dir =  "docs"
    ) %>% 
  yml_navbar(
    left = list(
      navbar_page("Home", href = "index.html"),
      navbar_page("Lectures", href = "lectures.html"),
      navbar_page("Labs", href = "labs.html")
    )) %>% 
  asis_yaml_output(fences = FALSE)
```

</div>

<div class= side2>
![](images/rmd_custom/new_page.png)

</div>
</div>

You may have noticed that in the YAML options weâ€™ve looked at so far, `left:` has been one of the first things to go under `navbar:`. You can add all (or just some) of your links aligned to the right side of the navbar instead by using `right:`. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
yml_empty() %>% 
  yml_navbar(
    left = list(),
    right = list()
    ) %>% 
  asis_yaml_output(fences = FALSE)
```

\

If we added the page for `labs.Rmd` to the right of our navbar instead:
<div class = side-by-side>
<div class = side1>

```{r echo = FALSE}
yml_empty() %>% 
  yml_site_opts(
    name = "YUM-101",
    output_dir =  "docs"
    ) %>% 
  yml_navbar(
    left = list(
      navbar_page("Home", href = "index.html"),
      navbar_page("Lectures", href = "lectures.html")
    ),
    right = list(
      navbar_page("Labs", href = "labs.html")
    )) %>% 
  asis_yaml_output(fences = FALSE)
```

</div>

<div class= side2>

<!--todo: insert new screenshot here-->

</div>
</div>


## Hiding pages {#hide-rmd}

```{r, out.width = "40%", fig.align='center', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_custom/Hiding.jpg")
```
Have an R Markdown file that you'd like to keep under wraps? If you leave it off of your navbar and don't link to it elsewhere, then it's unlikely anyone will ever see it, but it will still be rendered when you build your site. If you don't want the `.Rmd` to be rendered at all, then save it with a filename that begins with an underscore `_`. All files with underscores get passed over when it's time to render the site (but they'll still be in your repository).
