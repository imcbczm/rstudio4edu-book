Inclusion of ‘pro-tips content’ throughout content I do like the pedagogical patterns section, though I see how including something like this greatly increases the scope of our project. I think what I like most about it, is that they’re concrete examples of creative use-cases. The tips and tricks section I find to be useful, practical advice. In thinking of how this applies toour own project, I think a lot of this could be condensed into little “tips” boxes. Different ways of running Jupyter w/ pros and cons. Useful for educators to know ahead of time Stuff I don’t like as much Needs way more color, pictures, graphics. I think there is too much text for this to be an effective way of “selling” the notebooks. You have to read a lot of prefaces before you get to the practical implementations and concrete examples. Tone is kinda dry Not sure if it’s the layout, but I think just by nature of it being a book, it doesn’t feel like as a user that I can or should skip around to only the sections I need. It’s hard to know which sections will be most useful to me when I “arrive” to this resource. "],
