# Preface {-}

Welcome! This handbook was inspired by the [Handbook for Teaching and Learning with Jupyter](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/)- a book written by and for educators who teach data science. It is a thoughtful and inspiring resource for all educators, with a focus on the Python ecosystem. We aimed to create a similar resource for educators working with the R and RStudio ecosystem. 

If you do educational work and use tools in this ecosystem, you may have seen a great tutorial made with R Markdown, or attended a streamlined workshop where learning the content was front-and-center and all the headaches around installation and setup were absent. Or maybe you have stumbled upon a polished workshop, book, or course website and thought: __"I want to make that too!"__ So that is what we have set out to do: make a handbook that will fill in those gaps for educators to create educational materials that engage learners, inspire other educators, and most importantly save you time and make it more fun for you to teach.

Paraphrasing from Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester's ["What They Forgot to Teach You About R"](https://whattheyforgot.org/index.html):

> *"We focus on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in creating educational materials, __outside of doing the teaching itself__."*

If you find these materials useful, give us a shout-out on Twitter using `#rstudio4edu`. We hope you do! If you have ideas for ways to improve them, please consider contributing to the project.


## Why `rstudio4edu`? {-}

Educators from a range of fields use R and RStudio in the "classroom." But the definition of the "classroom" is changing. 

The classroom can be an actual one that includes real-time interaction with learners, as in school and university settings. 

Or the classroom can be a virtual one, where learners interact asynchronously with educational materials. For example, learners on their own time can peruse an online tutorial, or they can attend a remote webinar-style workshop where real-time interactions simply aren't part of the education experience.

Finally, there are temporary classrooms- those that pop up like food truck pods. Learners pick a truck to decide what they want to learn, they get served up some educational materials and enjoy it in real-time with an instructor and other learners. The hope is that they pack up some knowledge "to go boxes" that they will put into practice when the instructor is long gone.

We know that people in fields like ecology, sociology, digital history, psychology, biology, genetics, neuroscience, pharmacology, and bioinformatics for education- not just those who teach data science or statistics.


## Who are you? {-}

TO DO: shorten to be more like [Greg's](http://teachtogether.tech/#s:intro-audience)

Who did we make this handbook for? We envision that this handbook is for all end-user teachers: teaching may or may not be part of your formal job description, you may not have formal training in how to teach, and you may teach in a formal classroom setting, but you may also teach virtually (via webinars or online tutorials), or perhaps you teach in short but intense bursts like in-person workshops and small-group trainings. 

In short, if you are a person who needs or wants to create educational materials using R / RStudio, then we hope you'll find this handbook useful- it is definitely for you.

1. **Lucy:** Lucy is a professor of neuropsychology who also teaches stats to first year graduate students. She is comfortable using R in her research but experiences imposter syndrome when in conversation with colleagues who have had formal training in computer science. She'd like to learn how to use R in her course in a way that won't overcomplicate things for students and will maximize instruction time (and minimize set up time). Lucy is juggling half a dozen responsibilities at work, and doesn’t have a lot of time to learn or test out many new systems for delivering her teaching content. 

1. **Willis:** Willis Workshopper is a senior data scientist and is responsible for training his (remote) company's team and occasionally leads in-person workshops. Willis considers himself an experienced programmer with formal training in computer science. He uses R all the time for analysis, but needs a training platform that will allow him to create and organize one-time training materials-- he'd like all materials to be easily implemented by users in both remote (work team) and in-person (workshop) contexts. He can be particular about his material's aesthetics and layout and wants the ability to customize everything. 

1. **Ona**: Ona heads a team that assists researchers and organizations design and track their project progress. She needs to train up her team of employess who have different R skill levels (sometimes none). Ona knows R but would not call herself a programmer, and she essentially knows nothing about web development. She has been emailing R files back-and-forth with team members as a means of sharing results and analysis, but she knows there has to be a better way to compile these materials and train her team, but isn't sure how to begin navigating new resources to learn to do this. Additionally, her team is limited in budget and time and does not have enough time or energy to read R-related books.
